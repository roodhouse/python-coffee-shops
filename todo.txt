4. Bugs 
    
    
    4. clicking an answer in the form more than once will append a new value instead of overwriting the first value
    5. initial load still hows totals as 4500%.. need to run the aggregate results function sometime before a new venue is added 
    6. rating does not round but can be displayed as 33.33333 etc
    7. create new user, color is assigned, but next click show a different color
    8. a new review for an existing venue first time does not save the comment to the db, editing the review will save the comment
    9. simple rate on venue not from seeds still change wrong category, click on icons is off too
        - could be for when a category does not have any data
    10. heart icon also not changing aggregate data on a new venue, or reflecting on main page
    11. edit form on summary nothing is being pulled in (image etc) and it is registering as undefined for the venue
    12. on pages page in mobile view a state with only 2 cities, the 2nd city does not fit the container
    13. comment section: - if see less comments is active, then it shows the 2nd comment avatar, if it is closed then when opened the 2nd comment avatar is not seen, seems to only happen when logged in
    14. filter: when all icons in space are selected then the layout breaks
    15. on large map the zoom should be more so that the area is more in center
    16. css changes to map features, like map icons etc
    17. only allow return on cofeeshops etc when using google search
