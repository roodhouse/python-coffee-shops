    - add logic to comment section -- here!
        - what issues are outstanding with comment section?
                - // user logged in and is owner of one of the many comments @ count 4
                    - it shows the same comment at top for each user, want it to show the logged in users comment first
                    - if see less comments is active, then it shows the 2nd comment avatar, if it is closed then when opened the 2nd comment avatar is not seen
                - want the two links to be on the same level but doing this has created other issues
                - want to current users comment to always be at the top
                - want the edit comment link to always be with the current users comment
            - while logged out -- here!
                - without comments
                - with comments
            - while logged in
                - with own comment
                - with other user comment
                - with no comment
        - if current user has a comment then display it on top with the choice to delete or edit, 
        else display the newest comment with a choice to add their overwriting
        - fix above links
        - turn edit link to change view to show input textarea with previous comment loaded for edit comment or the textarea fresh for a new comment
    - add filter logic
        - change color of filter icon to the aggregate review color
        - when clicking on filter sort list by those venues that have a rating for that filter
    - add info to map markers

4. Bugs 
    - after adding new venue and review the form is not cleared -- unless a refresh is made
    - logic for if venue has already been added
    - if view venue, log in, and then view venue again state does not update to see that user has left review or not
    - set up history array so that when a login click happens and a successful login occurs it takes the user back to the page they came from
    - clicking an answer in the form more than once will append a new value instead of overwriting the first value
    - initial load still hows totals as 4500%.. need to run the aggregate results function sometime before a new venue is added 
    - rating does not round but can be displayed as 33.33333 etc
    - create new user, color is assigned, but next click show a different color
    - a new review for an existing venue first time does not save the comment to the db, editing the review will save the comment
    - need to pull in the comment to the form when editing
    - only show review section on store page if there is a review 
    - wait to pass over any review without xcom and show the first comment with an xcom value if any
    - review comments stopped appearing...
    - simple rate on venue not from seeds still change wrong category, click on icons is off too
        - could be for when a category does not have any data
    - heart icon also not changing aggregate data on a new venue, or reflecting on main page
    - edit form on summary nothing is being pulled in (image etc) and it is registering as undefined for the venue
    - on pages page in mobile view a state with only 2 cities, the 2nd city does not fit the container
