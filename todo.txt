3. API's needed:
    - google maps

4. Bugs 
    - after adding new venue and review the form is not cleared -- unless a refresh is made
    - logic for if venue has already been added
    - if view venue, log in, and then view venue again state does not update to see that user has left review or not
    - set up history array so that when a login click happens and a successful login occurs it takes the user back to the page they came from
    - clicking an answer in the form more than once will append a new value instead of overwriting the first value
    - initial load still hows totals as 4500%.. need to run the aggregate results function sometime before a new venue is added 
    - rating does not round but can be displayed as 33.33333 etc
    - create new user, color is assigned, but next click show a different color
    - a new review for an existing venue first time does not save the comment to the db, editing the review will save the comment
    - need to pull in the comment to the form when editing
    - only show review section on store page if there is a review 
    - wait to pass over any review without xcom and show the first comment with an xcom value if any
    - after adding several simple rate reviews the it seems to update the wrong component or wrong line
        - veggie and alcohol are somehow connected...
