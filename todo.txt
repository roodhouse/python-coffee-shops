1. frontend
    - dashboard view
        - onClick edit avatar
            - click outside of mod and mod closes -- here!
            - upload window
    - places page
        - create city database
        - send name of city to city db on submit, count as well? logic for state?
        - pull city table in the places view
        - change state of currentCity to clicked city and return city name and count on home page       
    - add logic to comment section
        - if current user has a comment then display it on top with the choice to delete or edit, 
        else display the newest comment with a choice to add their overwriting
        - turn edit review link into edit comment and change view to show input textarea with previous comment loaded
    - add filter logic
        - change color of filter icon to the aggregate review color
        - when clicking on filter sort list by those venues that have a rating for that filter

4. Bugs 
    - after adding new venue and review the form is not cleared -- unless a refresh is made
    - logic for if venue has already been added
    - if view venue, log in, and then view venue again state does not update to see that user has left review or not
    - set up history array so that when a login click happens and a successful login occurs it takes the user back to the page they came from
    - clicking an answer in the form more than once will append a new value instead of overwriting the first value
    - initial load still hows totals as 4500%.. need to run the aggregate results function sometime before a new venue is added 
    - rating does not round but can be displayed as 33.33333 etc
    - create new user, color is assigned, but next click show a different color
    - a new review for an existing venue first time does not save the comment to the db, editing the review will save the comment
    - need to pull in the comment to the form when editing
    - only show review section on store page if there is a review 
    - wait to pass over any review without xcom and show the first comment with an xcom value if any
    - review comments stopped appearing...
    - simple rate on venue not from seeds still change wrong category, click on icons is off too
        - could be for when a category does not have any data
    - heart icon also not changing aggregate data on a new venue, or reflecting on main page
