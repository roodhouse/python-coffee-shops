1. frontend
    dashboard view
        update post view

2. backend setup and connection
    - create tables and populate
                here!
                 -- currently in the sendToDataBase fucnction in addFormContext
            -- storeSummaryIcons
                // change been here to reflect if there has been a review filled out for the user or not,
                if not then ask if they would like to reivew
                // change default heart color to the result of the sum field if the user has a review for this venue
            - update store page to reflect aggregated data
            - change icons on hover and add onClick to allow update of reviews if logged and have reviewed
            - change review to allow null values
            - create way for 2nd user to add review for same location
        --individual page
        - comments
    - connect forms (answers)
    - create logic for aggregating results

3. API's needed:
    - google maps

4. Bugs 
    - login session is deleted after a refresh or navigating away from page
    - after adding new venue and review the form is not cleared
    - logic for if venue has already been added
    - if view venue, log in, and then view venue again state does not update to see that user has left review or not
    - set up history array so that when a login click happens and a successful login occurs it takes the user back to the page they came from
    - clicking an answer in the form more than once will append a new value instead of overwriting the first value
