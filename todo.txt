1. frontend
    dashboard view
        update post view

2. backend setup and connection
            - change default heart color to the result of the sum field if the user has a review for this venue - here!
            - change icons on hover and add onClick to allow update of reviews if logged and have reviewed
            - change review to allow null values
        --individual page
        - comments
    - dashboard
        - create delete review route

3. API's needed:
    - google maps

4. Bugs 
    - login session is deleted after a refresh or navigating away from page
    - after adding new venue and review the form is not cleared -- unless a refresh is made
    - logic for if venue has already been added
    - if view venue, log in, and then view venue again state does not update to see that user has left review or not
    - set up history array so that when a login click happens and a successful login occurs it takes the user back to the page they came from
    - clicking an answer in the form more than once will append a new value instead of overwriting the first value
    - initial load still hows totals as 4500%.. need to run the aggregate results function sometime before a new venue is added 
    - each venue is getting a new aggregate upon running of function...
    - rating does not round but can be displayed as 33.33333 etc
